# Budgeting Application

## Project Details

- This application will be allow users to make a budget then track their spending compared to their budget. Users will be able to enter details such as income, expenses, bills, and debt for their budget. Then they will be able to enter their spending details and assign each spending item to one of the budgeted catagories and view statistics on their spending (such as the catagory most purchases).

- This application will be used by people who want to keep track of their money and practice good budgeting habits.

- This is a project of interest to me because I have been practicing budgeting for a long time, using a spreadsheet template to keep track of my spending. I want to create an application that I can use to make my budgetting process faster and more convienent.
